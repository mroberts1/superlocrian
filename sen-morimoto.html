<p>I’ve been a fan of Sen Morimoto since I first saw him opening the 88rising show in Boston in 2018. Other than a few black guys, I was what seemed like the only non-Asian in the entire theater. At the start of the show some lanky Japanese-American kid with a ponytail comes out with a boombox and a saxophone and does some numbers of him rapping and playing over beats and samples from the box. He was well received, but everybody was there for the 88rising stars like Chinese hip-hop crew Higher Bros., Japanese-American crooner Joji, and Indonesian rap legend Rich Brian. Not long after, people were dancing in the aisles to the other acts and holding up their collective iPhone flashlights the way people used to do with cigarette lighters when Led Zeppelin played “Stairway to Heaven” several decades before they were born.</p>
<p>I was too swept up in the rest of the show to think much about Sen at the time, but over the following year I started coming across his music videos on YouTube and eventually found my way over to his debut album <em>Cannonball</em> on Bandcamp. </p>
<p>Not many people seem to know about Sen and compared to the other 88rising artists I don’t think he’s gotten anything like the kind of recognition that he deserves. If you’re not familiar with his music, what follows are a few thoughts on what I like about Sen’s music, and why you should too.</p>
<h3 id="chicago">Chicago</h3>
<p>Although he grew up in Massachusetts, Sen is based in Chicago and is a key part of the city’s vibrant and eclectic music scene, which includes bands like Tortoise. Along with a couple of other local artists, he’s co-founder of the local indie label Sooper Records, which has also released both of his own albums to date, the aforementioned <em>Cannonball</em> (2018) and the self-titled <em>Sen Morimoto</em> (2020). I don’t know a lot about that scene other than what I’ve gleaned from a few of Sen’s interviews, but my sense is that Chicago’s music scenes also tend to be neglected compared to all the attention given to other U.S. music cities, including nearby Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, and Nashville. But this isn’t an intro to  Chicago’s music scenes - back to what I like about Sen’s music.</p>
<h3 id="his-flow">His flow</h3>
<p>Watch that video posted above, or even if you already did watch it again. One of the cool things about Sen’s flow is that it always seems to lag just a little behind the beat. It’s almost imperceptible but it’s there. In contrast to the chronic overuse of quantization in electronic music production, which automatically syncs music to the beat in robotic fashion, this feels more authentic and human, a quality that’s been pointed out in discussion of other producers like J Dilla. It’s also a characteristic of jazz, which Sen grew up listening to and is one of the main components of his own distinctive mix.</p>
<h3 id="his-beats">His beats</h3>
<p>Beats are the bedrock of any popular music today, and Sen knows how to make beats. His beats are quirky, often use unusual samples, change abruptly in mid-song, and are always surprising and interesting.</p>
<h3 id="he-works-with-kaina">He works with Kaina</h3>
<p>Kaina is just flat-out awesome. What more is there to say? Yes, I know that there are a lot of great female vocalists in that style out there - I’ve been a fan of Yukimi Nagano of Swedish band <a href="http://little-dragon.net/">Little Dragon</a> for years - but Kaina’s vocals in the video of “Picture of a Painting” give me goosebumps. Oh and speaking of goosebumps: </p>

<p>Kaina also has her own album, also released of course by Sooper. Go and listen to it right now.</p>
