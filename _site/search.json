    "text": "Superlocrian is a music blog. The idea is to showcase artists that I think are worth paying attention to and try not get in the way of the music.\nThe Superlocrian (usually styled Super Locrian) is a scale frequently used in jazz improvisation, also known as the Altered Dominant scale.\nIt includes no less than five altered tones: ♭9, ♯9, ♭5, ♯5, and ♭7, so C Super Locrian would be: C - D♭ - D♯ - F♭ - G♭ - G♯ - B♭.\nThe Super Locrian differs from the Locrian mode in that in addition to the existing altered scale tones, it includes a ♭4, i.e. whereas in C Locrian mode the fourth is F, in C Super Locrian this is flatted to E (F♭). In other words, other than the tonic, every tone of the major scale is altered.\nInterestingly – albeit confusingly, at least to music theory novices like me – the Super Locrian is identical to the seventh mode of the Melodic Minor scale.

I don’t even like K-pop - if by K-pop you mean what “K-pop” is generally understood to be, internationally.\nBut even though I dislike most “K-pop,” I do like certain Korean musical artists, bands, and music scenes a lot; and I think the scale of the global understanding of “K-pop” is so great that it’s really time I wrote something.\nIf you’re reading this because you’re “a huge fan of K-pop,” then, sorry to disappoint you: it’s not going to talk about BTS, Blackpink, or Red Velvet. Instead, I try to expand the one-dimensional understanding of “K-pop” beyond the endless parade of synchronized boy and girl bands, by sharing some of what I know about the incredibly diverse music scenes in Korea today, but that have been overshadowed by the global “K-pop” industry. Because of the very partial nature of the latter, however, whenever I refer to it as “K-pop” in quotation marks, to differentiate it from the proliferating landscape of music scenes in Korea today."

    "text": "“K-pop” is not “Korean popular music”\nWhat is “K-pop”?\nIt’s not what you think it is.\nInternationally, it’s a multi-billion dollar global industry with fandoms stretching around the globe from Santiago to Sydney. Just a few weeks ago, K-pop band Seventeen played Glastonbury, the legendary half-century-old music festival in the UK, for the first time.. (For the record, I’d never heard of Seventeen, which tells you how much I care about “K-pop”.) This kind of “first K-pop band to…” has itself become a global cliché–Epik High at Coachella (2016), Blackpink as the first female K-pop group at Coachella (2019), and on and on.Jon Dunbar, “First Koreans to play Glastonbury” (The Korea Times, 15 July 2024)\nIn response to the international ubiquity of K-pop boy and girl bands, the past few years have seen a rapid cultural institutionalization of “K-pop”, in the form of museum exhibitions, as part of the larger international craze for the Hallyu or “Korean Wave”. K-pop fandom in itself has been quickly reified as a phenomenon of global culture in its own right, distinct from the object of the fandom itself. The “K-pop” industry today is arguably as much driven by such institutionalization, with the line between “top-down” and “organic” fan communities becoming more or less non-existent.See for example the international exhibition “Hallyu! The Wave” held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London from 24 Sepember 2022-25 June 2023, and subsequently at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts from 24 March to 28 July 2024.The V&A website includes a section specifically on “K-pop fandom.”\nThe rapid cultural blitzkrieg of “K-pop” and the “Hallyu” more generally has also taken place at an academic level: a simple search for “K-pop” on Academia.edu returns over a million sources.\n\n\n\n\nThe question of why “K-pop” and its global fandom have proved to be such a lucrative commodity of the global culture industry is a larger question that I’m sure has been addressed somewhere in the vast academic literature on the subject that has emerged over the past five years or so. “K-pop” fandom is an exhausting black hole that I’m simply not interested in exploring, since to do so would be fall into the exact same trap that this post is supposed to be trying to escape from. So if it’s really “K-pop” music and fandom that you’re interested in, I can only refer you to the million points of light on Academia.edu."

    "section": "Popular music scenes in Korea",
    "text": "Popular music scenes in Korea\nIn trying to get a broader understanding of K-pop, it’s useful to draw an initial distinction between what’s understood as “K-pop” internationally and domestically. Within Korea itself, “K-pop” - in the form of boy and girl group-led, synchronized industrial dance pop - enjoys even greater mass popularity than it does internationally. Again, there is much to be said on “K-pop” within Korea, but again, the Korean music industry itself has been discussed endlessly and this discussion is not driven solely by mass-cultural success - in fact this is precisely the kind of simplistic yardstick that I am trying to break free form. What I find much more interesting are the music scenes that tend to be overlooked - certainly outside Korea - because the discussion of Korean popular music is so entirely monopolized by a mass-cultural logic that assumes that the more popular and commercially successful something is, the more valuable and important it is. This post explicitly refuses this logic as a criterion of aesthetic and cultural value.\nMy first proposition, then, is that both domestically and internationally, “K-pop” (as defined thus far) accounts for only the dominant, most mainstream style within the larger landscape of Korean popular music. Within that landscape, I’m not going to talk about older historical forms of Korean popular music such as trot, for example. This is simply because I don’t know enough about them. Nor, for the same reason, do I have much to say about the premodern forms of Korean popular music collectively known as gugak.\nKorean popular music today takes many different forms, often in the form of localized transformations of globally circulating styles. “K-pop” itself, of course, can be seen as an example of this, originating in Black U.S. dance musics from Motown soul to R’n’B to hip hop, especially the elaborately choreographed 1980s dance music of Michael and Janet Jackson. But that is only one example. In what follows I try to tease out some of these threads."

    "text": "Originally posted on the 33 1/3 blog on 11 March 2020 following the publication of my book Cornelius’s Fantasma (New York: Bloomsbury, 2019)\nLike so many other stories about pop music fandom, this one begins with a record store.\nIn 1995, a tiny record store opened on West 4th Street in Manhattan, literally across the street from Tower Records’ flagship megastore. Issuing a warning to its giant neighbor, Other Music, as it was pointedly named, specialized in musical genres not available at Tower Records, from Krautrock to free jazz to noise music. By the time I moved to New York, in 1997, Other Music had already established itself as what we would now call a “scene.” As soon as we were done with classes for the day, my friends and I would head over there in the late afternoon and run into one another browsing through the new releases. In those days everything was on CD other than a section of vinyl 12-inches along one wall, but there were no listening stations and the only way to preview a record was to get the guys to play it on the in-store sound system, an often intimidating task. Since iTunes, Soundcloud, Bandcamp and Beatport didn’t exist, word-of-mouth recommendation—usually eaves-dropped from other conversations—was the best alternative to buying blind. Although the space was cramped, sometimes there would be in-store sets by musicians passing through: I remember watching Robin Rimbaud scanning mobile phone conversations from the surrounding neighborhood into a live set in the late 90s. Other Music had genres you didn’t even know existed, and sections with exotic names like Decadanse, a catch-all category which included lounge music (1990s club culture’s remix of 1960s easy listening), French yéyé, Brazilian bossa nova, Bollywood soundtracks, and Japanese pop—not mainstream J-pop but indie and club music with futuristic artwork. Other Music had Japanese music that you couldn’t get at Tower: it was here that I bought my first CDs by Pizzicato Five, Fantastic Plastic Machine, Minegawa Takako, Kahimi Karie, cult bands like Shonen Knife or Polysics—and, inevitably, Cornelius. And it was at Other Music that, in spring 1998, I bought my CD of Fantasma. I had no idea at the time that several decades later I would write a book about it.\nRather than exemplifying any single coherent style, the Japanese bands were eclectic, often combining multiple styles within the same song, from the acid jazz of Kyoto Jazz Massive to Yukari Fresh’s retro-pop homages to British footballers. They were cool not just because they were different, but because they were so sophisticated: the French New Wave-influenced music videos of Pizzicato Five, fronted by the effortlessly elegant Maki Nomiya; Kahimi Karie’s kittenish pastiches of 1960s French pop divas like France Gall or Jane Birkin; the quirky Cassio-pop of Minegawa Takako; or the mash-ups of bossa nova and breakbeats of Cornelius. It wasn’t until later that I discovered that these musicians were part of a movement known as Shibuya-kei, because of its association with another record store: the giant Tower Records store in the Shibuya neighborhood of Tokyo (the suffix -kei means “style”). Although the music of Shibuya-kei artists was promoted at the Tower Records and HMV megastores in Shibuya, it had originated outside them, in the teeming ecosystem of record stores of 1980s Tokyo from which the Shibuya sound emerged.\nIt wasn’t until I began visiting Tokyo regularly in the early 2000s and began visiting Tower Records Shibuya, as well as vintage megastores like Disk Union, that I experienced this extraordinarily cosmopolitan music culture first hand. While mainstream J-pop and Anglo-American pop, rock, and hip-hop occupied entire floors, others included large sections devoted to indie artists, world music, or jazz. On every visit to Tokyo, we were like kids in a (pretty expensive) candy store: time stopped at the hundreds of listening stations at Tower, and after two or three hours of browsing the latest releases, each carefully annotated with details of recommended tracks, you could easily wonder where the afternoon or evening had gone. It was at these listening stations that fans of Cornelius would have first heard Fantasma after its release in the summer of 1997.\nThe musicians responsible for the Shibuya sound, like ourselves in New York in the late 1990s, were record collectors in search of new, interesting sounds outside their immediate cultural context. They prided themselves on their expansive musical tastes, from easy listening to Motown to the neopsychedelia of the Happy Mondays and Primal Scream. In New York we were listening to a heady cocktail of global pop and club music mixed by conspicuous cosmopolitans like Uwe Schmidt (aka Señor Coconut), Dimitri from Paris, Nicola Conte, Sunahara Yoshinori, Tanaka Toshiyuki, and Konishi Yasuharu. When we encountered the Shibuya-kei artists, it felt like meeting kindred spirits. This was music by hipsters, for hipsters, although the term has always had a much less negative resonance in Japan than it has acquired in the U.S.\nWe didn’t know it then, but Other Music both anticipated and lent momentum to the post-millennial rise of hipster culture, with its rejection of mass-market popular music. As Tower Records went the way of the dinosaurs with the advent of digital downloads, closing its doors in 2006, Other Music continued to prosper, even launching its own record label, until it too finally succumbed to the inevitability of digital downloads and streaming services in 2016. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, the Tower Records store in Shibuya has somehow managed to survive the digital age, although it has been transformed in the process. Not long ago, a friend visiting Tower Records in Shibuya posted a photo on Facebook of a display featuring a collage of vintage promotional flyers, crowned by the slogan “No Diggin’, No Life.” Tower hadn’t yet merged with Disk Union, but the slogan was an indication of how far record collecting has now itself become part of the musical mainstream. We are all record collectors now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Jun Oshima, this section of the store was curated by DJ Muro to commemorate the 1990s crate-digging culture of Shibuya using event flyers and promotional items from the era.\nSource: Jun Oshima, Facebook, 25 June 2017"

    "text": "I: College Radio\nI discovered Brazilian music several decades ago, after relocating to Boston from the UK where I grew up. Boston has a pretty sizeable Brazilian community, and WERS, the radio station at Emerson College (where I now teach) had a show called “Coração Brasileira” that introduced me to all of the major styles and artists since the 1960s: samba and bossa nova, of course, but also forró, choro, Tropicália, and the 1970s MPB (Música Popular Brasileira) movement. “Coração Brasileira” introduced me both to the classics (Tom Jobim, João Gilberto, Nara Leão, Edu Lobo, Elis Regina) and artists like Gal Costa, Maria Bethânia, Joyce, Jorge Ben, Ivan Lins, Djavan, and Simone, as well as rising stars like Marisa Monte and Leila Pinheiro.\nI would tape “Coração Brasileira” every week (this was still towards the end of the audiocassette era) and started accumulating albums by Milton Nascimento, Ivan Lins, and Tom Jobim from the world music section of the giant Tower Records store on Newberry Street. Two albums had a big impact on me: the first compilation in the Belleza Tropical series put out by David Byrne’s new Luaka Bop world music label; and on the new digital format of CD, Brasileiro (1992), Latin-Jazz legend Sergio Mendes’s collaboration with hip-hop musicians like Carlinhos Brown that relaunched his popularity in the U.S.\nAnother show I listened to avidly every Monday night was “Things That Go Bump In The Night,” a free-form jazz show on Tufts radio. I liked the show so much that I became friends with the guy who did it, Steven Cantor. Steve was a friend of Lyle Mays, the keyboardist of the Pat Metheny group, and co-produced Lyle’s first two albums with him. Through him, I heard that Pat had an apartment in Rio and was often down there recording; his records of the time, such as Still Life Talking (1987), showcased Brazilian vocalists and percussionists. Steve became a musical mentor for me, and through his show I discovered Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges’s Clube da Esquina records, the extraordinary jazz musician Hermeto Pascoal, and Egberto Gismonti.\nBrazilian music was not hard to find in Boston back then. The place where I was living in Cambridge was within walking distance of the jazz club Ryles on Inman Square, where Spanish singer Olga Román performed weekly sets of bossa and MPB standards with her French band. I saw Pat Metheny there at an unannounced “secret” show with Dave Holland and Japanese trumpeter Tiger Okoshi; Lyle Mays sat in at one of Olga Román’s sets. Brazilian artists regularly came through on tours, and I was lucky enough to see shows by Djavan, Milton Nascimento, and Hermeto Pascoal.\nAll of which is to say that by the time I finally had chance to go to Brazil, to attend a conference in the northeastern city of Maceió (home of Djavan), I was already pretty familiar with Brazilian music. I spent a couple of blissful days in Rio, having lunch on the cafe terrace where Tom Jobim was reportedly inspired to write “The Girl From Ipanema,” and catching a live set by Margareth Menezes. The flight up to Maceió included a brief stop in Salvador de Bahia, the epicenter of Afro-Brazilian music, and I still regret not getting off the plane there and then. Needless to say, I returned to Boston with a slew of records by my favorite artists as well as new discoveries like Adriana Calcanhoto and rock band Titãs."

    "text": "II. Future Listening\nBy the time I moved to New York in the late 1990s, Brazilian music was already the cornerstone of the thriving club jazz and lounge music scenes, much of it filtered through Japanese DJs and artists. Towa Tei’s album Future Listening! (1994) featured Bebel Gilberto, daughter of Jõao Gilberto and niece of Chico Buarque, and a bossa sung by Pizzicato Five’s Maki Nomiya. Bebel Gilberto’s club-oriented album Tanto Tempo (2000) was an instant classic that seemed to be playing in every bar and club; of course I saw her perform it live. I also came across Arto Lindsay, an experimental guitarist and producer who was involved in the No Wave independent rock scene. He’d grown up in Brazil and recorded in Portuguese on albums such as the exquisite O Corpo Sutil (1996).\nOne of the highlights of my time in New York was a show by Sergio Mendes at the Blue Note, attended by a strange generational mix of old-school fans of his Brazil ’66 band, 90s fans of Brasileiro, and young Japanese hipsters. Another was the all-too-brief collaboration between Miho Hatori of the hip-hop duo Cibo Matto and Beck guitarist Smokey Hormel at John Zorn’s club Tonic, in which they performed Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes’s classic album Os Afro-Sambas (1966). It left me with a love of Baden Powell that has continued to this day. Perhaps the most memorable of all, though, was the sublime performance by Ryuichi Sakamoto with Jacques and Paula Morelenbaum of Tom Jobim’s songbook, Casa (2001).\nOver the next decade I began making regular trips to Tokyo and became increasingly immersed in the Japanese bossa nova scene - Lisa Ono, its reigning queen, whose club Saci Pererê we visited one New Year’s Eve when I unfortunately was sick with flu; and duos like Naomi & Goro and Arthur & Sabrina. We finally caught up with Lisa Ono at Tokyo’s swanky Blue Note, one of the most expensive shows I’ve ever seen (in Japan, jazz is a luxury item). One of my favorite stores when we lived in Tokyo for six months in 2012 was Mermelada, which specialized in Brazilian percussion instruments. I went there looking for a cuica, but was eventually persuaded to start with something easier, and bought a pandeiro instead."

In recent years I’ve become fascinated by the band’s weird fusion of Brazilian folk, Sergeant Pepper-era Beatles songs, and psychedelic rock, most in evidence on their self-titled début album, Os Mutantes (1968). One of the many interesting things about Tropicália as an artistic and political movement is that music was only one of its components, which also included film (such as Glauber Rocha’s influential film Terra em Transe (1967), theater, and literature."

    "text": "IV: Aquarela do Brasil\nI don’t listen to as much Brazilian music these days as I used to, and am not very well up on the latest artists. While internationally most people still associate it with samba and bossa nova, Brazilian music is an incredibly diverse field, having evolved its own localized versions of just about every style of global popular music, from reggae to hip-hop to metal.\nI’ll listen to anything from Far Out Recordings, Joe Davis’s label in the UK that has been reissuing long-lost recordings by artists like jazz fusion band Azymuth. In recent years I’ve mainly been listening to old recordings by Joyce or Hermeto Pascoal, including his collaboration with the brilliant vocalist Aline Morena. More recent bands that I’d recommend are Apollo Nove and Democustico. Every now and again, I come across something that stops me in my tracks. Alice Caymmi’s first album was one such record. In Brazil, music runs in lineages: Bebel Gilberto is João Gilberto’s daughter; Clara Moreno is Joyce’s daughter, Alice Caymmi is the granddaughter of one of the founders of bossa nova, Dorival Caymmi.\nI hope that one day I’ll get a chance to go back to Brazil. In the meantime, I can at least enjoy a film that remains one of my all-time favorites: Black Orpheus (1959), a retelling of the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice in the contemporary setting of a Rio favela. The image of the children ecstatically dancing to Ary Barroso’s classic “Aquarela do Brasil” in the final sequence is in my view one of the most beautiful in all of cinema. Interestingly, and as so often with Brazilian music and culture, its international impact was mediated by an outsider: the film’s director, Marcel Camus, was French. I’ll have more to say at some point about Brazil’s French connection, notably the collaboration between Pierre Barouh and Baden Powell in the documentary Saravah (1970). I also haven’t even said anything about why I like Brazilian music, and the endlessly-discussed concept of saudade. But that will have to wait for another time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve been a fan of Sen Morimoto since I first saw him opening the 88rising show in Boston in 2018. Other than a few black guys, I was what seemed like the only non-Asian in the entire theater. At the start of the show some lanky Japanese-American kid with a ponytail comes out with a boombox and a saxophone and does some numbers of him rapping and playing over beats and samples from the box. He was well received, but everybody was there for the 88rising stars like Chinese hip-hop crew Higher Bros., Japanese-American crooner Joji, and Indonesian rap legend Rich Brian. Not long after, people were dancing in the aisles to the other acts and holding up their collective iPhone flashlights the way people used to do with cigarette lighters when Led Zeppelin played “Stairway to Heaven” several decades before they were born.\nI was too swept up in the rest of the show to think much about Sen at the time, but over the following year I started coming across his music videos on YouTube and eventually found my way over to his debut album Cannonball! on Bandcamp.\nNot many people seem to know about Sen and compared to the other 88rising artists I don’t think he’s gotten anything like the kind of recognition that he deserves. I’m not going to review his albums here - I just recommend that you head over to Bandcamp and check them out yourself. But if you’re not familiar with his music, here are a few thoughts on what I like about Sen’s music, and why you should too.\n\nChicago\nAlthough he grew up in Massachusetts, Sen is based in Chicago and is a key part of the city’s vibrant and eclectic music scene, which includes bands like Tortoise. Along with a couple of other local artists, he’s co-founder of the local indie label Sooper Records, which has also released both of his own albums to date, the aforementioned Cannonball! (2018) and the self-titled Sen Morimoto (2020). I don’t know a lot about that scene other than what I’ve gleaned from a few of Sen’s interviews, but my sense is that Chicago’s music scenes also tend to be neglected compared to all the attention given to other U.S. music cities, including nearby Detroit, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, and Nashville. But this isn’t an intro to Chicago’s music scenes - back to what I like about Sen’s music.\n\n\nHis flow\nWatch that video posted above, or even if you already did watch it again. One of the cool things about Sen’s flow is that it’s always just a little behind the beat. It’s almost imperceptible but it’s there. In contrast to the chronic overuse of quantization in electronic music production, which automatically syncs music to the beat in robotic fashion, this feels more authentic and human, a quality that’s been pointed out in discussion of other producers like J Dilla. It’s also a characteristic of jazz, which Sen grew up listening to and is one of the main components of his own distinctive mix.\n\n\nHis beats\nBeats are the bedrock of any popular music today, and Sen knows how to make beats. His beats are quirky, often use unusual samples, change abruptly in mid-song, and are always surprising and interesting.\n\n\nHe works with Kaina\nKaina is just flat-out awesome. Yes, I know that there are a lot of great female vocalists out there - I’ve been a fan of Yukimi Nagano of Swedish band Little Dragon for years - but Kaina’s vocals in the video of “Picture of a Painting” give me goosebumps. Oh and speaking of goosebumps:\n\n\n\nSidenote: this video shows that Sen also knows how to write a great ballad.\nKaina has an album of her own on Sooper, Next To The Sun (2019), and released her second album, It Was A Home, on 4 March 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rhodes\nYou probably noticed the Nord Electro in the video above, the go-to keyboard that all the cool bands seem to have. I’ve been coveting one for years myself, while making do with my own 1971 Fender Rhodes and and Korg’s Module app on my iPhone. The Nord has one of the best versions around of that rich, buttery Rhodes sound that’s the audio signature of 1970s jazz fusion, and that sound is all over Sen’s tracks. But all of his retro keyboard sounds are great, from wheezy Hammond B-3s to the Vox Continental.\n\n\nThat Space Jazz Vibe\nMost of all with Sen, though, it’s about that space jazz Vibe, which somehow manages to be both laid back and emotional at the same time. It’s a tricky balancing act to pull off, but Sen is quite a musical tightrope walker. You won’t find a better example of this space jazz vibe than the appropriately-titled “Jupiter”."

    "text": "In 2020 bassist Michael Pipoquinha and guitarist Pedro Martins released an album of duets called Cumplicidade [Complicity], featuring guest cameos by 71-year-old jazz guitarist Toninho Horta and singer Mônica Salmaso.\nBack in the 1970s, Horta played on both of Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges’s albums, Clube da Esquina (1972) and Clube da Esquina 2 (1978), widely regarded as two of the finest releases in the history of Brazilian popular music.\nSalmaso is one of the newer generation of Brazil’s many brilliant female vocalists; last year she released an album of covers of Milton Nascimento songs, Milton (2022), with pianist André Mehmari.\nThe connections leading us back to the Clube da Esquina group––directly in the case of Toninho Horta––aren’t coincidental; Brazil’s current generation of musicians are hyper-aware of the extraordinarily rich cultural heritage that they come out of, and their contemporary music is in constant dialogue with it.\nCumplicidade is a great record, but what’s even better is that videos of the whole studio recording session are on YouTube, so we get to watch two (actually four) virtuoso musicians at the top of their game. I love it that Michael and Pedro are playing in studio slippers––it seems to capture the cosy, intimate vibe of the whole session.\nI’ve put together the playlist and you can watch it all over there, but here are my favorite cuts from the session: the two songs with Toninho, the song with Mônica Salmaso, and their cover of Hermeto Pascoal’s song “Azeitona.”\nI’ll have more to say on the group that I call the Clube da Esquina Novo [New Corner Club] in an upcoming post; for now, enjoy the complicity. :)\n\nRaul (feat. Toninho Horta) (4:58) \n\n\nMr. Herbie (feat. Toninho Horta) (5:40) \n\n\nBolero de Satã (feat. Mônica Salmaso) (5:16) \n\n\nAzeitona (5:07)"
