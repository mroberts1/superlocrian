Superlocrian is a music blog that I'm trying to get going. The idea is to showcase artists that I think are worth paying attention to and try  not get in the way of the music.

The Superlocrian (usually styled Super Locrian) is a scale frequently used in jazz improvisation, also known as the Altered Dominant scale. 

It includes no less than five altered tones: flat9, sharp9, flat5, sharp5, and flat7, so C Super Locrian would be: C - Db - D# - E - Gb - G# - Bb. 

The Super Locrian differs from the Locrian mode in that in addition to the existing altered scale tones, it includes a flat4, i.e. whereas in C Locrian the fourth is F, in C Super Locrian this is lowered to E (aka Fb). In other words, other than the tonic, every tone in the major scale is altered.

Interestingly - albeit confusingly, at least to music theory novices like me - the Super Locrian is identical to the seventh mode of the Melodic Minor scale. More [<span style="font-family:HelveticaNeueLTStd-BdEx">here</span>](https://www.pianoscales.org/super-locrian.html).
