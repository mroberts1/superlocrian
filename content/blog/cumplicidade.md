<p>In 2020 bassist Michael Pipoquinha and guitarist Pedro Martins released an album of duets called _Cumplicidade_ [_Complicity_], featuring guest cameos by 71-year-old jazz guitarist Toninho Horta and singer Mônica Salmaso. 
    
<p>Back in the 1970s, Horta played on both of Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges’s albums, _Clube Da Esquina_ (1972) and _Clube Da Esquina 2_ (1978), widely regarded as two of the finest releases in the history of Brazilian popular music.</p>

<p>Salmaso is one of the newer generation of Brazil's many brilliant  female vocalists; concidentally, last year she released an album of covers of Milton Nascimento songs, _Milton_ (2022), with pianist André Mehmari.</p>

<p>_Cumplicidade_ is a great record, and fortunately for us videos of the studio sessions for half of the songs on the album were posted on YouTube. Here they are as a playlist, reordered according to my own preferences. We start with Toninho’s song “Raul,” and finish with their cover of the classic Hermeto Pascoal song “Azeitona.”</p> 

<p>The connections leading us back to the _Clube Da Esquina_ group–directly in the case of Toninho Horta–aren't coincidental; Brazil's  current generation of musicians are hyper-aware of the extraordinarily rich cultural heritage that they come out of, and their contemporary music is in constant dialogue with it. I'll have more to say on this current generation that I call the “Clube Da Esquina Novo” [new Corner Club] in a future post.
