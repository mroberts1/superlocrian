In 2020 bassist Michael Pipoquinha and guitarist Pedro Martins released an album of duets called _Cumplicidade_, featuring cameos by legend Toninho Horta and singer Mônica Salmaso. It's a great record, and fortunately for us they also posted videos of the studio performances of half of the songs on YouTube. Here they are as a playlist, reordered according to my own preferences. We start with Toninho's song "Raul," and finish with their cover of Hermeto Pascoal's classic "Azeitona."
