<p>In 2020 bassist Michael Pipoquinha and guitarist Pedro Martins released an album of duets called <b>Cumplicidade</b> [Complicity], featuring guest cameos by 71-year-old jazz guitarist Toninho Horta and singer Mônica Salmaso. 
    
<p>Back in the 1970s, Horta played on both of Milton Nascimento and Lô Borges’s albums, <b>Clube Da Esquina</b> (1972) and <b>Clube Da Esquina 2</b> (1978), widely regarded as two of the finest releases in the history of Brazilian popular music.</p>

<p>Salmaso is one of the newer generation of Brazil's many brilliant  female vocalists; last year she released an album of covers of Milton Nascimento songs, <b>Milton</b> (2022), with pianist André Mehmari.</p>

<p>The connections leading us back to the <b>Clube Da Esquina</b> group––directly in the case of Toninho Horta––aren’t coincidental; Brazil’s current generation of musicians are hyper-aware of the extraordinarily rich cultural heritage that they come out of, and their contemporary music is in constant dialogue with it. 
    
<p><b>Cumplicidade</b> is a great record, and to make it even better,  videos of the studio session for the whole album are on YouTube. I've  put together the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKJL7wxYKW3P49SSgWIY8hKQTDpdR6X_v"><span style="text-decoration:underline">playlist</span></a> and you can watch it all over there, but here are my favorite cuts from the session: the two songs with Toninho, the song with Mônica Salmaso, and their cover of Hermeto Pascoal’s classic, “Azeitona.”</p>
    
<p>I love it that Michael and Pedro are playing in their slippers––it seems to capture the cosy, intimate vibe of the whole session.</p>

<p>I'll have more to say on the group that I call the <b>Clube Da Esquina Novo</b> [New Corner Club] in an upcoming post; for now, enjoy the complicity. :)</p>
