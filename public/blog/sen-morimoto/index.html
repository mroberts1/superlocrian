<p>I’ve been a fan of Sen Morimoto since I first saw him opening the 88rising show in Boston in 2018. Other than a few black guys, I was what seemed like the only non-Asian guy in the entire theater. At the start of the show some lanky Japanese-American kid with a ponytail comes out with a boombox and a saxophone and does some numbers of him rapping and playing over beats and samples from the box. He was well received, but everybody was there for the 88rising stars like Chinese hip-hop crew Higher Bros., Japanese-American crooner Joji, and Indonesian rap legend Rich Brian. Not long after, people were literally dancing in the aisles to the other acts and holding up their collective iPhone lights the way prof-rock fans used to do to Led Zeppelin’s performances of “Stairway to Heaven” several decades before they were born.</p>
<p>I was too swept up in the rest of the show to think about Sen very much at the time, but over the following year I started coming across his music videos on YouTube and eventually got around to checking out his debut album <em>Cannonball</em>. </p>
<p>What follows are a few thoughts on what I like about Sen’s music, and why you should too.</p>
