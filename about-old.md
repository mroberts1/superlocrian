Superlocrian is a music blog. The idea is to showcase artists that I think are worth paying attention to and try  not get in the way of the music.

The Superlocrian (usually styled Super Locrian) is a scale frequently used in jazz improvisation, also known as the Altered Dominant scale. 

It includes no less than five altered tones: ♭9, ♯9, ♭5, ♯5, and ♭7, so C Super Locrian would be: C - D♭ - D♯ - F♭ - G♭ - G♯ - B♭. 

The Super Locrian differs from the Locrian mode in that in addition to the existing altered scale tones, it includes a ♭4, i.e. whereas in C Locrian mode the fourth is F, in C Super Locrian this is flatted to E (F♭). In other words, other than the tonic, every tone of the major scale is altered.

Interestingly - albeit confusingly, at least to music theory novices like me - the Super Locrian is identical to the seventh mode of the Melodic Minor scale. More [here](https://www.pianoscales.org/super-locrian.html).
